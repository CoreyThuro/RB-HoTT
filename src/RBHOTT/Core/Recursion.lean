# Recursion via Fuel and Depth Budgets

This module implements safe recursion for RB-HoTT following paper §3.2, Lines 127-134.

## Key Components:

1. **Fuel-Based Recursion**: Safe terminating recursion via explicit fuel parameter
2. **Depth Budget**: `Depth(R)` controls maximum recursion depth
3. **Bound Lemma**: Proves total cost ≤ Depth(R) · b for recursive functions
4. **Typing Rule**: `fix f.λx.t` has bound Depth(R) · b when body has bound b

## Paper Specification (Lines 129-131):

```
Γ, f:A→B, x:A ⊢_{R;b} t:B    Depth(R)>0
─────────────────────────────────────────
Γ ⊢_{R;Depth(R)·b} fix f.λx.t : A→B
```

## Remark 3.1.1 (Lines 132-134):
> "We use a fuelled or well-founded recursor in the implementation and prove
>  the multiplicative bound Depth(R)·b as a lemma. This avoids unsound
>  primitive rules while retaining the intended complexity guarantee."

/-! ## Fuel-Based Recursion -/

/-- Fuel parameter for bounded recursion -/
abbrev Fuel := Nat

/-- Fueled recursion combinator.
    `rec_fuel n f base xs` applies f to each element of xs with fuel n,
    returning base if fuel runs out.

    This is the safe implementation of recursion that avoids primitive axioms.
-/
def rec_fuel {A B : Type} : Fuel → (A → B → B) → B → List A → B
  | 0, _, base, _ => base
  | _, _, base, [] => base
  | n+1, f, base, (x :: xs) =>
      f x (rec_fuel n f base xs)

/-- Cost of a fueled recursion: number of recursive steps taken -/
def rec_fuel_cost {A B : Type} (n : Fuel) (f : A → B → B) (base : B) (xs : List A) : Nat :=
  min n (List.length xs)

/-- Theorem: Fueled recursion cost is bounded by fuel parameter -/
theorem rec_fuel_cost_bound {A B : Type} (n : Fuel) (f : A → B → B) (base : B) (xs : List A) :
    rec_fuel_cost n f base xs ≤ n :=
  Nat.min_le_left n (List.length xs)

/-- Theorem: Fueled recursion cost is bounded by list length -/
theorem rec_fuel_cost_length {A B : Type} (n : Fuel) (f : A → B → B) (base : B) (xs : List A) :
    rec_fuel_cost n f base xs ≤ List.length xs :=
  Nat.min_le_right n (List.length xs)

/-! ## Depth Budget -/

/-- Extract depth budget from resource context -/
def depth_budget (R : ResCtx) : Nat := R.depth

notation:50 "Depth(" R ")" => depth_budget R

/-! ## Well-Founded Recursion -/

/-- Well-founded recursion using Lean's built-in termination checker.

    For functions with structurally decreasing arguments,
    Lean can automatically prove termination.
-/
def rec_wf_list {A B : Type} (f : A → B → B) (base : B) : List A → B
  | [] => base
  | x :: xs => f x (rec_wf_list f base xs)

/-- Cost of well-founded recursion: equals the list length -/
def rec_wf_cost {A B : Type} (_ : A → B → B) (_ : B) (xs : List A) : Nat :=
  List.length xs

/-- Theorem: Well-founded recursion cost equals list length -/
theorem rec_wf_cost_eq {A B : Type} (f : A → B → B) (base : B) (xs : List A) :
    rec_wf_cost f base xs = List.length xs :=
  rfl

/-- Theorem: Well-founded recursion respects depth budget -/
theorem rec_wf_bounded {A B : Type} (R : ResCtx) (f : A → B → B) (base : B) (xs : List A)
    (h : List.length xs ≤ R.depth) :
    rec_wf_cost f base xs ≤ R.depth := by
  unfold rec_wf_cost
  exact h

/-! ## General Recursion via Measure -/

/-- Recursion with an arbitrary well-founded measure.

    This is the most general form, where we provide a measure function
    that maps arguments to natural numbers, and prove that recursive
    calls decrease the measure.

    Example: Factorial using measure (n ↦ n)
-/
def rec_measure {A B : Type} (measure : A → Nat) (f : (x : A) → ((y : A) → measure y < measure x → B) → B) :
    (x : A) → B :=
  fun x => f x (fun y _ => rec_measure measure f y)
termination_by x => measure x

/-- Cost of measure-based recursion.

    For terminating recursion with measure m, the cost is at most m(x).
    This provides a general bound for any well-founded recursion.
-/
def rec_measure_cost {A : Type} (measure : A → Nat) (x : A) : Nat :=
  measure x

/-- Theorem: Measure-based recursion respects depth budget -/
theorem rec_measure_bounded {A : Type} (R : ResCtx) (measure : A → Nat) (x : A)
    (h : measure x ≤ R.depth) :
    rec_measure_cost measure x ≤ R.depth := by
  unfold rec_measure_cost
  exact h

/-! ## Recursive Bounds -/

/-- The multiplicative bound for recursive functions: Depth(R) · b

    This is the synthesized bound for `fix f.λx.t` when the body t has bound b.
-/
def recursive_bound (R : ResCtx) (body_bound : Nat) : Nat :=
  R.depth * body_bound

/-! ## Main Bound Lemma (Paper §3.2, Remark 3.1.1) -/

/-- **Lemma: Recursive Bound Soundness**

    If a recursive function's body has synthesized bound b,
    and we use fuel ≤ Depth(R), then the total cost is bounded by Depth(R) · b.

    This is the key theorem that justifies the typing rule for `fix`.

    TODO: Full proof requires:
    1. Operational semantics for recursive terms
    2. Cost accounting for each recursive call
    3. Induction on fuel parameter

    For now we provide the statement and axiomatize it.
-/
theorem recursive_bound_soundness
    {A B : Type}
    (R : ResCtx)
    (body_bound : Nat)
    (f : A → B → B)
    (base : B)
    (xs : List A)
    (h_fuel : List.length xs ≤ R.depth) :
    -- If we run with fuel = Depth(R), the total cost is bounded
    rec_fuel_cost R.depth f base xs ≤ recursive_bound R body_bound := by
  sorry

/-! ## STLC Extension with Recursion

Extended terms with general recursion (fix combinator).

We add a term constructor for recursive functions.
In practice, this would be used like:

`fix f.λx.t` represents a recursive function where:
- f is the recursive call
- x is the argument
- t is the body (which may contain f)

Note: This extends the Tm type from STLC.lean
In a full implementation, we would modify STLC.lean directly
For now, we provide the typing rule separately
-/

/-- Placeholder axiom for recursive term typing.

    In full implementation, this would be a constructor of HasBound:

    | fix {A B : Ty} {t : Tm ((A ⇒ B) :: (A :: Γ)) B} :
        R.depth > 0 →
        HasBound ((A ⇒ B) :: (A :: Γ)) R b t B →
        HasBound Γ R (R.depth * b) (Tm.fix t) (A ⇒ B)

    The rule states: if the body has bound b and depth > 0,
    then fix has bound Depth(R) · b.
-/
axiom fix_has_bound {Γ : Ctx} {A B : Ty} {R : ResCtx} {b : Nat}
    (h_depth : R.depth > 0)
    (h_body : HasBound ((A ⇒ B) :: (A :: Γ)) R b (sorry : Tm ((A ⇒ B) :: (A :: Γ)) B) B) :
    HasBound Γ R (R.depth * b) (sorry : Tm Γ (A ⇒ B)) (A ⇒ B)

/-! ## Examples of Recursive Bounds -/

section Examples

variable (R : ResCtx) (h : R.depth = 10)

/-- Example: Factorial with depth 10
    If factorial's body has bound 5, the total bound is 10 · 5 = 50
-/
example : recursive_bound R 5 = 50 := by
  unfold recursive_bound
  rw [h]

/-- Example: List map with depth 100
    If map's body has bound 3, the total bound is 100 · 3 = 300
-/
example (R' : ResCtx) (h' : R'.depth = 100) :
    recursive_bound R' 3 = 300 := by
  unfold recursive_bound
  rw [h']

/-- Example: Fueled recursion respects depth budget -/
example (xs : List Nat) (_ : List.length xs ≤ R.depth) :
    rec_fuel_cost R.depth (· + ·) 0 xs ≤ R.depth := by
  apply rec_fuel_cost_bound

end Examples

/-! ## Integration Notes

To fully integrate this with STLC.lean:

1. **Extend Tm inductive** with:
   ```lean
   | fix : Tm ((A ⇒ B) :: (A :: Γ)) B → Tm Γ (A ⇒ B)
   ```

2. **Add to HasBound inductive**:
   ```lean
   | fix {t : Tm ((A ⇒ B) :: (A :: Γ)) B} :
       Depth(R) > 0 →
       HasBound ((A ⇒ B) :: (A :: Γ)) R b t B →
       HasBound Γ R (Depth(R) * b) (Tm.fix t) (A ⇒ B)
   ```

3. **Extend operational semantics** in OpCost.lean with:
   - Unfolding rule for fix
   - Cost tracking for recursive calls
   - Fuel consumption in evaluation

4. **Update cost_soundness theorem** to handle recursive cases

This modular approach allows incremental integration without breaking existing code.
