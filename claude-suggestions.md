  🔍 RB-HoTT Codebase vs. Paper Alignment Analysis

  Executive Summary

  Current State: Items #1 and #2 from the action list have been completed successfully.
  The codebase implements foundational resource contexts with ordering and feasible
  natural numbers with proper budget constraints.

  Critical Finding: ⚠️ Even assuming all items in the action list are completed, there are
   SIGNIFICANT gaps between what the paper claims and what the codebase would deliver.

  ---
  ✅ What IS Aligned (Items #1 & #2 Complete)

  1. Resource Contexts (Paper §3.1, Lines 143-150)

  Paper Claims:
  Resource context R = (time, mem, depth) ∈ ℕ³
  Pointwise preorder ≤
  Monoidal sum ⊕ with monotonicity

  Codebase Reality: ✅ FULLY ALIGNED
  - src/RBHOTT/Res.lean implements all three components
  - Order properties proven (reflexivity, transitivity)
  - Monotonicity of ⊕ proven in both arguments
  - Trans instance enables calc mode (enhancement beyond paper)

  2. Feasibility Modality Foundation (Paper §3.4, Lines 204-210)

  Paper Claims:
  □_R A means "A available at budget R"
  Basic rules: A → □_R A, monotonicity R ≤ R' ⇒ □_R A → □_{R'} A

  Codebase Reality: ✅ PARTIALLY ALIGNED
  - FeasibleNat structure implements the concept for natural numbers
  - widen function implements monotonicity (R ≤ S transport)
  - bound_le_time constraint makes feasibility meaningful

  Gap: Paper discusses general modality □_R A for any type A; code only has FeasibleNat.
  This is acknowledged in action list Item #6 (Modality stubs).

  ---
  ❌ CRITICAL GAPS: What the Paper Claims but Code Lacks

  1. STLC + Cost Semantics (Paper §3.2-3.3, Lines 154-198)

  Paper Claims (Lines 154-198):
  -- Typing with synthesized bounds
  Γ ⊢_{R;b} t : A

  -- Application rule (Line 161-162)
  Γ ⊢_{R;b_f} f : A→B    Γ ⊢_{R;b_a} a : A
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
  Γ ⊢_{R;b_f+b_a+1} f a : B

  -- Pair rule (Line 163-165)
  Γ ⊢_{R;b_a} a : A    Γ ⊢_{R;b_b} b : B
  ─────────────────────────────────────
  Γ ⊢_{R;b_a+b_b} (a,b) : A×B

  -- Operational semantics (Lines 186-193)
  (λx.t) v → t[v/x] [cost: 1]
  π₁(v₁,v₂) → v₁ [cost: 1]
  if true then t else f → t [cost: 1]

  Codebase Reality: ❌ COMPLETELY MISSING
  - No file RBHOTT/Cost.lean (action list Item #3)
  - No types: Ty, Tm, Ctx
  - No typing judgment ⊢_{R;b}
  - No reduction relation → or multi-step ⇒*
  - No Step, MultiStep, Value definitions
  - No substitution subst

  Impact: The paper's central cost-soundness theorem (Theorem 3.1, Line 196-198) cannot
  even be stated:
  If Γ ⊢_{R;b} t : A and t closed, then ∃v,k. t ⇒* v with k ≤ b ≤ Time(R)

  Action List Status: Item #3 (P1 priority) - NOT STARTED

  ---
  2. Conditionals with Max-Bound Rule (Paper §3.2, Lines 169-172)

  Paper Claims:
  Γ ⊢_{R;b_c} c : Bool    Γ ⊢_{R;b_t} t : A    Γ ⊢_{R;b_f} f : A
  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Γ ⊢_{R;b_c+max(b_t,b_f)+1} if c then t else f : A

  Codebase Reality: ❌ MISSING
  - No Bool type in RB system
  - No if expression
  - No max-bound composition rule

  Action List Status: Item #4 (P1 priority) - NOT STARTED

  ---
  3. Recursion via Fuel (Paper §3.2, Lines 174-182)

  Paper Claims (Lines 175-178):
  Γ, f:A→B, x:A ⊢_{R;b} t:B    Depth(R)>0
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
  Γ ⊢_{R;Depth(R)·b} fix f.λx.t : A→B

  Paper's Safe Implementation Strategy (Remark, Lines 180-182):
  "We use a fuelled or well-founded recursor in the implementation and prove the 
  multiplicative bound Depth(R)·b as a lemma. This avoids unsound primitive rules while 
  retaining the intended complexity guarantee."

  Codebase Reality: ❌ MISSING
  - No fixF or fuel-based recursor
  - No fix_cost_mul_depth theorem
  - No RBHOTT/Rec.lean file

  Action List Status: Item #5 (P1 priority) - NOT STARTED

  ---
  4. Dependent Types (Paper §5, Lines 268-291)

  Paper Claims (Lines 272-278):
  -- Dependent products
  Γ ⊢_{R;b_A} A : type    Γ, x:A ⊢_{R;b_B} B(x) : type
  ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Γ ⊢_{R;b_A+b_B} Π_{x:A}B(x) : type

  -- Similarly for Σ types, Id types

  Codebase Reality: ❌ MISSING
  - No dependent products Π
  - No dependent sums Σ
  - No identity types Id
  - Only simple types via FeasibleNat structure

  Paper's Timeline: "Mid-term (3-9 months)" per roadmap (Lines 388-393)

  Action List Status: Item #10 (Future) - Acknowledged as post-P1

  ---
  5. Modality Stubs + Laws (Paper §3.4, Lines 204-221)

  Paper Claims (Lines 206-219):
  -- Basic rules
  A → □_R A
  R ≤ R' ⇒ □_R A → □_{R'} A

  -- Advanced rules (schematic)
  □_R A ∧ □_R B ⇒ □_R(A ∧ B)
  □_{R₁} A ∧ □_{R₂} B ⇒ □_{R₁⊕R₂}(A ∧ B)
  □_R(A → B) ∧ □_R A ⇒ □_R B

  Codebase Reality: ❌ PARTIALLY MISSING
  - ✅ widen implements monotonicity for FeasibleNat
  - ❌ No general Avail R A type
  - ❌ No product preservation lemmas
  - ❌ No file RBHOTT/Modality.lean

  Action List Status: Item #6 (P2 priority) - NOT STARTED

  ---
  6. Tests and Examples (Paper §7, Table 1, Lines 362-373)

  Paper Claims (Lines 362-373):
  Table 1: Static bounds vs. measured execution
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────
  Algorithm            | Static | Measured | Ratio
  Merge Sort (n=1000) | 13,500 | 11,234  | 1.20×
  Binary Search (1024)|     15 |     14  | 1.07×

  Also mentions (Lines 141-147):
  - src/Examples/ResProps.lean - ordering/monotonicity tests
  - src/Examples/FeasibleNatDemo.lean - widen and fadd tests
  - src/Examples/STLCDemo.lean - β-step and if examples

  Codebase Reality: ❌ COMPLETELY MISSING
  - No src/Examples/ directory exists
  - No test files at all
  - No benchmark data
  - Cannot verify paper's claimed ratios

  Action List Status: Item #7 (P0 priority!) - NOT STARTED

  ---
  7. Binary Search Example (Paper §4.2, Lines 237-266)

  Paper Claims (Lines 240-264):
  structure Res := (time mem depth : Nat)

  notation R:65 " ⊕ " R':65 =>
    Res.mk (R.time + R'.time) (R.mem + R'.mem)
           (max R.depth R'.depth)

  abbrev R_bs (n : Nat) : Res := 
    ⟨Nat.ceil (Nat.log2 n) + 5, n, Nat.log2 n⟩

  axiom binarySearch : (arr : Array α) → (target : α) 
    → □(R_bs arr.size) (Option Nat)

  axiom binarySearch_correct : 
    ∀ arr target result, 
      binarySearch arr target = some result → 
      arr[result] = target ∧ result < arr.size

  axiom binarySearch_bounded :
    ∀ arr target, cost (binarySearch arr target) ≤ R_bs arr.size

  Codebase Reality: ❌ MISSING
  - No binary search implementation
  - No Array type in RB context
  - No □ modality for general types
  - No cost function
  - These are axiomatized in paper, but demonstrate intended usage

  Note: Paper uses axioms for illustration, but implementation would require Items #3-6
  first.

  ---
  8. Engineering Features (Paper §6, Lines 292-341)

  Paper Claims (Lines 296-299):
  cost(t) = α·nodes(t) + β·lamDepth(t) + γ·apps(t) + δ·cases(t)

  Also claims (Lines 303-316):
  -- Wrapper example
  @[simp] def length {α} (l : List α) : Nat :=
    List.length l

  theorem length_bound (l : List α) : 
    cost (length l) ≤ l.length + 3 := by
    unfold length cost
    sorry -- Full proof available in artifact

  And (Lines 319-338):
  # CI budget checking workflow
  name: Resource Budget Check

  Codebase Reality: ❌ COMPLETELY MISSING
  - No RBHOTT/ProofCost.lean (structural metrics)
  - No RBHOTT/Budget.lean (persistent env ext)
  - No scripts/check_budgets.lean
  - No CI workflow files
  - No example wrappers with budgets

  Action List Status: Item #8 (P2 priority) - NOT STARTED

  Completion Rate: 2/13 major components = 15.4%

  🎯 Action List vs. Paper Requirements

  The action list correctly identifies most gaps, but there's a priority misalignment:

  Action List Says P0 (Critical):

  1. ✅ ResCtx Preorder - DONE
  2. ✅ FeasibleNat budget - DONE
  3. ❌ Tests - NOT STARTED

  Issue: Item #7 (tests) is P0 but not started. Without tests, we can't verify Items #1-2
  actually work as claimed.

  Action List Says P1 (High Priority):

  3. ❌ STLC + cost core - NOT STARTED
  4. ❌ Bool/if with max-bound - NOT STARTED
  5. ❌ Recursion via fuel - NOT STARTED

  Issue: Without Items #3-5, the paper's central theorem (cost soundness) cannot be stated
   or proven. These should arguably be P0.

  What the Paper Emphasizes vs. What Code Has

  Paper's Central Claim (Abstract, Lines 61-63):
  "RB-HoTT makes resource bounds first-class: types carry explicit budgets, and proofs 
  certify both functional correctness and resource compliance."

  Required for this claim:
  1. ✅ Types with explicit budgets (ResCtx) - DONE
  2. ❌ Proofs certifying costs (cost soundness theorem) - MISSING
  3. ❌ Examples demonstrating certification (binary search, etc.) - MISSING

  ---
  🔴 Critical Missing Piece: Cost Soundness Theorem

  Paper's Core Theorem (Theorem 3.1, Lines 196-198):
  If Γ ⊢_{R;b} t : A and t is closed, 
  then ∃v,k. t ⇒* v with k ≤ b ≤ Time(R)

  This theorem is the entire point of RB-HoTT. Without it:
  - No certification of resource compliance
  - No connection between synthesized bounds and actual costs
  - No validation that the system actually works

  Current status: Cannot even be stated because:
  - No typing judgment ⊢_{R;b} (need Item #3)
  - No reduction relation ⇒* (need Item #3)
  - No cost measurement k (need Item #3)

  ---
  🚨 Main.lean Analysis: Red Flag

  Current Main.lean (Lines 1-12):
  import RBHOTT.Core
  open RBHOTT

  def main : IO Unit := do
    let R : ResCtx := { time := 10, memory := 2048, depth := 3 }
    let x : FeasibleNat R := { val := 2, bound := 5, h := by decide }
    let y : FeasibleNat R := { val := 3, bound := 7, h := by decide }
    let z := RBHOTT.FeasibleNat.fadd x y
    IO.println s!"R = {repr R}"
    IO.println s!"x = {repr x}, y = {repr y}"
    IO.println s!"z.val = {z.val}, z.bound = {z.bound}"

  Issues:
  1. Wrong constructor syntax: Uses old 2-field structure { val := 2, bound := 5, h := by 
  decide }
    - Should be 4-field: { val := 2, bound := 5, val_le_bound := by decide, bound_le_time 
  := by decide }
  2. Missing argument to fadd: Calls fadd x y but current signature is fadd x y (h_sum : 
  x.bound + y.bound ≤ R.time)
  3. This file won't compile with current Core.lean

  Implication: The "working" project status claimed in the memory is questionable. Let me
  verify:

⏺ Bash(lake build 2>&1 | head -30)
  ⎿  Build completed successfully.

⏺ Interesting - it builds despite the issues in Main.lean. Let me check if Main.lean is
  actually being built:

⏺ Read(lakefile.lean)
  ⎿  Read 14 lines

⏺ Bash(lake build rbhott 2>&1)
  ⎿  Error: ✖ [3/7] Building Main

⏺ Perfect - this confirms Main.lean is broken. The library builds but the executable
  doesn't.

  📝 Final Assessment

  Alignment Summary: Paper Claims vs. Actual Code

  If all action list items were completed, the alignment would improve significantly, but
  critical gaps would remain:

  ✅ Would Be Aligned (with action list completion):

  1. Resource algebra fundamentals (§3.1)
  2. Simply-typed core with costs (§3.2, Items #3-5)
  3. Basic modality laws (§3.4, Item #6)
  4. Test infrastructure (§7, Item #7)

  ❌ Would Still Be Missing:

  1. Dependent types (§5) - acknowledged as future work
  2. Presheaf semantics (§4) - acknowledged as future work
  3. Engineering infrastructure (§6):
    - No proof cost metrics
    - No CI budget checking
    - No mathlib wrappers
  4. Actual cost soundness proof - Action list only asks for STLC scaffold, not the proof
  5. Real examples with budgets - Binary search is axiomatized in paper, not implemented

  ---
  🎯 Constructive Feedback (Critical)

  1. Immediate Fix Required: Main.lean is Broken

  The executable doesn't compile. This needs fixing before any claims of "working
  implementation."

  Fix:
  let x : FeasibleNat R :=
    { val := 2, bound := 5, val_le_bound := by decide, bound_le_time := by decide }
  let y : FeasibleNat R :=
    { val := 3, bound := 4, val_le_bound := by decide, bound_le_time := by decide }
  let z := RBHOTT.FeasibleNat.fadd x y (by decide : x.bound + y.bound ≤ R.time)

  2. Priority Misalignment in Action List

  Current priorities don't match paper's claims:

  - Item #7 (Tests) should be P0, not just listed as P0 but actually started
  - Cost soundness proof should be explicit goal, not just "scaffold STLC"
  - Item #8 (CI/engineering) is P2, but paper emphasizes this heavily in §6

  Recommendation: Revise action list to make cost soundness theorem the primary P0 goal.

  3. Gap Between Paper's Ambition and Code Reality

  Paper promises (Lines 61-63):
  "types carry explicit budgets, and proofs certify both functional correctness and 
  resource compliance"

  Current reality:
  - ✅ Types carry budgets (ResCtx)
  - ❌ No proofs certifying costs (no cost soundness theorem)
  - ❌ No demonstration of certification (no worked examples)

  This is 1/3 of the core promise delivered.

  4. Main.lean Should Be a Showcase, Not a Bug Farm

  The paper presents sophisticated examples (binary search, merge sort benchmarks). The
  actual Main.lean:
  - Doesn't compile
  - Only demonstrates trivial addition
  - Doesn't showcase the system's value proposition

  Recommendation: Replace Main.lean with a compelling example that demonstrates resource
  certification (once Items #3-7 are complete).

  5. Documentation/Paper Synchronization

  The paper's roadmap (§8, Lines 379-400) claims "near-term (0-3 months)" for:
  - Cost-soundness proof for STLC
  - Modality interface with monotonicity lemmas
  - Open repository with CI

  Reality: None of these exist yet, and Items #3-8 are not started.

  Recommendation: Either:
  - Update paper roadmap to reflect actual state ("these are goals, not current features")
  - Accelerate development to match paper claims before publication

  6. Testing is Critical But Missing

  The paper claims specific benchmark ratios (Table 1, Lines 367-372). Without tests:
  - Can't verify claimed ratios
  - Can't validate Items #1-2 actually work correctly
  - Can't prevent regressions

  Recommendation: Item #7 should be next priority, even before Items #3-5.

  ---
  📋 Recommended Revised Action List Priorities

  Based on paper alignment analysis:

  Tier 0 (Publication Blockers):

  1. Fix Main.lean to actually compile
  2. Item #7: Tests for Items #1-2 (validate what's claimed as "done")
  3. Item #3: STLC + operational semantics

  Tier 1 (Core Claims):

  4. NEW ITEM: Prove cost soundness theorem for STLC
  5. Item #4: Bool/if (enables non-trivial examples)
  6. Item #5: Recursion via fuel
  7. NEW ITEM: Implement one real example (e.g., simple recursive function with certified
  bound)

  Tier 2 (Paper Polish):

  8. Item #6: Modality stubs
  9. Item #8: CI infrastructure
  10. Update paper to reflect actual vs. planned features

  Tier 3 (Future):

  11. Dependent types
  12. Presheaf semantics
  13. Mathlib integration

  ---
  🔬 Specific Technical Concerns

  Concern 1: Feasibility of Cost Soundness Proof

  The paper claims (Remark, Lines 180-182):
  "We use a fuelled or well-founded recursor and prove the multiplicative bound Depth(R)·b
   as a lemma."

  Question: Has anyone actually attempted this proof? Proving operational cost bounds in a
   proof assistant is non-trivial. The action list treats it as "scaffold file with
  β-step" (Item #3), but the actual proof might be much harder.

  Recommendation: Validate that the proof strategy works before publishing paper claims.

  Concern 2: DecidableEq in Main.lean

  The memory claims DecidableEq was "restored" for FeasibleNat, but Main.lean never uses
  it. There's no evidence it actually works for the intended purpose (runtime testing).

  Recommendation: Add actual tests that use decidable equality.

  Concern 3: Presheaf Semantics is Handwaved

  The paper extensively discusses presheaf semantics (§4, Lines 222-235) but:
  - No code implementing presheaves
  - No validation that the claimed interpretations actually work
  - Action list places this in "Future" but paper presents it as foundation

  Recommendation: Either implement enough to validate the claims, or clearly mark as
  "theoretical foundation, implementation future work" in paper.

  ---
  ✅ What's Good About Current Code

  Despite the gaps, the implementation of Items #1-2 is high quality:

  1. Clean, well-documented code with good naming
  2. Correct proofs using appropriate Lean 4 tactics
  3. Smart workarounds (Trans instance instead of Preorder) showing Lean expertise
  4. Proper abstractions (ResCtx.le, monotonicity lemmas)

  The foundation is solid. The issue is scope: only 15% of paper's claims are implemented.

  ---
  📊 Final Verdict

  Alignment Score: 2.5/10

  Breakdown:
  - ✅ Resource algebra: Perfect (2/2)
  - ❌ Cost semantics: Missing (0/3)
  - ⚠️  Feasibility modality: Partial (0.5/2)
  - ❌ Examples: Missing (0/1)
  - ❌ Tests: Missing (0/1)
  - ❌ Engineering: Missing (0/1)

  Critical Path to Alignment:

  To achieve minimal publishable state (6/10):
  1. Fix Main.lean ✅
  2. Complete Item #7 (tests) ✅
  3. Complete Items #3-5 (STLC + costs) ✅
  4. Prove cost soundness for STLC ✅
  5. One real example with certified bound ✅

  Estimated effort: 2-4 weeks full-time for experienced Lean developer

  To achieve paper's actual claims (8/10):
  - Add above + Item #6 (modality) + Item #8 (CI) + real benchmarks

  Estimated effort: 1-2 months full-time

  ---
  🎯 Bottom Line

  The paper oversells the current implementation by ~85%.

  The completed work (Items #1-2) is solid and correct, but represents only the
  foundational layer. The paper's central claims about "proof-carrying resources" and
  "certified resource compliance" require the cost semantics layer (Items #3-5) and
  testing infrastructure (Item #7), none of which exist yet.

  Recommendation: Either:
  1. Accelerate development to complete P0/P1 items before publication
  2. Revise paper to clearly distinguish "implemented" from "designed" features
  3. Reframe as vision paper rather than implementation paper

  The architectural design is sound and the vision is compelling, but the gap between
  vision and reality needs to be honestly communicated.
